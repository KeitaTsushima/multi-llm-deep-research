## Session Info
- Branch: feature/plan-01-llm-clients

## What I Did
- 🔄 Reviewed external feedback on implementation order
- ✨ Implementing PLAN-01 (config.py + llm_clients.py)

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Change

**Changes adopted**:
1. Skip skeleton/implementation two-phase approach → module-level completion
2. Write tests immediately after each module (not at the end)
3. Create PLAN-02/03/04 after implementation (with working code as reference)

**New order**:
1. config.py (implement + test)
2. llm_clients.py (implement + test)
3. PLAN-02/03/04

## Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Adopt module-level completion approach
- **Rationale**: Smaller modules benefit from completing in one pass; tests right after implementation catch bugs faster
- **Alternatives considered**: Original skeleton → implementation → test order (rejected due to increased iteration time and cognitive context-switching when alternating phases for small modules)

## Next Steps
- [x] Create daily log
- [ ] Implement config.py
- [ ] Write tests for config.py
- [ ] Implement llm_clients.py
- [ ] Write tests for llm_clients.py
- [ ] Update requirements.txt

## Notes for Future
- External feedback helps refine workflow
- For small modules (~100 lines), complete in one pass
