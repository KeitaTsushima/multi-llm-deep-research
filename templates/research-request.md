# Research Request Template

> This file is a generic research specification.
> Place a copy in your local workspace for each research project.

---

## 1. Research Theme

A short, clear description of the topic.

**Example:**
"Local Japanese Cultures and Highlights of Their Regional Washoku."

---

## 2. Background & Purpose

Explain:
- Why this topic is being examined
- What led to this research
- What value the synthesized insight should create

This section provides context but should remain concise.

---

## 3. Research Objectives

LLMs must attempt to achieve **all** of the following:

1. Identify **high-confidence facts** about the topic.
2. Surface **key concepts, entities, stakeholders, or components**.
3. Map **drivers, constraints, and context** (historical, cultural, regulatory, technological, economic, etc.).
4. Identify **distinguishing features** or patterns relevant to the topic.
5. Highlight **conflicting perspectives or uncertainties**.
6. Provide **evidence** (citations, links, reports) when available.

These objectives must guide the entire research output.

---

## 4. Research Questions

LLMs must directly address the following:

1. What defines this topic and its core components?
2. What forces (technological, social, economic, environmental, historical, etc.) shape or influence it?
3. Who are the main stakeholders or actors, and what roles do they play?
4. What are the main issues, opportunities, or unknowns?
5. Where do perspectives differ across sources or interpretations?

Add additional domain-specific questions as needed.

---

## 5. Expected Output Structure (Mandatory)

All LLMs must follow **this exact structure**:

### 5.1 Key Facts

High-confidence information that is broadly accepted or strongly supported.

### 5.2 Key Concepts / Entities

Important domain concepts, elements, stakeholders, systems, or tools.

### 5.3 Context & Drivers

Forces or conditions that influence the topic
(e.g., cultural, technological, historical, economic, political, environmental).

### 5.4 Distinguishing Features / Patterns

Unique characteristics, recurrent structures, or region/domain-specific traits.

### 5.5 Hypotheses

Plausible explanations or models of how or why certain phenomena occur.
Label each with confidence level: **High** / **Medium** / **Low**.

### 5.6 Conflicting Perspectives / Open Questions

Points where available information diverges, lacks clarity, or requires deeper inquiry.

### 5.7 Evidence & Sources

Links, citations, datasets, academic papers, credible reports, or examples.

### 5.8 Limitations

Uncertainties, missing data, areas susceptible to hallucination, or assumptions that may be unsafe.

---

## 6. Constraints

- LLMs must not ask for additional information.
- All reasoning must rely solely on this document.
- When data is insufficient, models must reason under uncertainty and mark it explicitly.
- No speculative claims without marking them as such.

---

## 7. Additional Notes (Optional)

Use this section for:
- Domain-specific nuances
- Definitions
- Warnings
- Scope boundaries
- Custom conditions for this particular research

(Leave blank if not needed.)

> **Applicability**: This template is domain-agnostic and suitable for cultural studies, technical research, business strategy, healthcare systems, policy analysis, market structure, scientific overviews, competitive landscapes, and social phenomena.

> **Guidance**: Models should prioritize depth, rigor, and clarity. Responses should favor thorough reasoning and well-supported analysis over brevity. Make full use of available reasoning capabilities and information sources, while clearly stating uncertainties and limitations.
