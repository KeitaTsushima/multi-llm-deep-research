## 1. Executive Summary

A concise summary (510 bullet points) covering:

- What this research is about
- The most important high-confidence findings
- The main uncertainties or conflicts
- The key implications for decision-making or further research

---

## 2. High-Confidence Facts

List the most important **high-confidence facts** about the topic.

For each item:

- State the fact in clear language
- Optionally indicate:
  - Which models support it
  - Whether there is cited evidence

---

## 3. Key Concepts, Entities, and Structure of the Topic

Explain:

- The main concepts, entities, stakeholders, systems, or components
- How they relate to each other
- Any useful conceptual frameworks or categorizations

If helpful, include:

- Lists
- Simple diagrams (in text)
- Taxonomies or typologies

---

## 4. Context & Drivers

Describe the **context** in which this topic exists:

- Historical background
- Cultural or social factors
- Technological or regulatory environment
- Economic or market forces
- Other relevant drivers

Focus on forces that **shape or constrain** the topic.

---

## 5. Distinguishing Features & Patterns

Clarify what makes this topic **distinctive**:

- Unique characteristics vs. similar domains or regions
- Recurring patterns or structures
- Notable outliers or edge cases

This section should answer:
> "What stands out once you've seen the whole landscape?"

---

## 6. Conflicting Perspectives & Open Questions

Summarize:

- Where models, sources, or perspectives **disagree**
- Competing explanations or narratives
- Major **open questions** that remain unresolved

For each, briefly note:

- Why it matters
- What kind of evidence would help resolve it

---

## 7. Strategic / Practical Implications

Translate the above into **actionable implications**, for example:

- For product or business strategy
- For policy or system design
- For research or innovation directions
- For operations or field practice

This section should be opinionated but grounded in the previous sections.

---

## 8. Priority Hypotheses to Test

List **hypotheses** that should be tested next, ordered by priority.

For each hypothesis:

- Statement of the hypothesis
- Rationale (what it would explain or unlock)
- What kind of test/experiment/validation would be appropriate

---

## 9. Recommended Next Actions

Concrete suggested next steps, such as:

- Additional desk research (which subtopics, which regions, which actors)
- Expert interviews (which profiles, what to ask)
- User or stakeholder interviews or observations
- Prototyping / PoC ideas
- Data collection or measurement

This is the "if you have limited time and budget, do this next" section.

---

## 10. Key Sources & References

List:

- The most important sources surfaced by the models
- Pivotal articles, papers, reports, or case studies
- Any particularly influential datasets or examples

This is not meant to be exhaustive; focus on **high-leverage references**.

---

## 11. Limitations of This Research Run

Be explicit about:

- Gaps in coverage
- Suspected hallucinations or weakly supported claims
- Structural biases in the underlying models or available sources
- Constraints in scope defined by the original research-request

This section should help future readers understand how far they can safely rely on this report.
